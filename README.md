# IR-Sensor-with-LED-IoT

## Description
This project demonstrates how an IR sensor can be used to detect an object and control an LED using Arduino.

## Components Used
- Arduino / ESP32
- IR Sensor
- LED
- Resistor
- Jumper wires

## Working
- IR sensor detects an object
- LED turns ON when object is detected
- LED turns OFF when no object is present

## Learning Outcomes
- Digital input and output
- Sensor interfacing
- Conditional logic in embedded systems
